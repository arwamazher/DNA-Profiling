# DNA-Profiling
This program reads in DNA files and databases in order to match people's DNA based on their STR (short-tandem repeats) counts. The STR counts each person has is stored in small.txt and large.txt. The DNA sequences are stored in files 1.txt to 20.txt. 

ourvector.h is a custom vector class that has most of the implementations of the standard vector class, but not all of them.
